## Project Highlights

### 01 — Google Review Responder

A production n8n multi-agent system that monitors Google My Business for new reviews and automatically crafts professional responses. It routes reviews through a **Text Classifier agent** to detect sentiment, then dispatches to either a **Positive Review agent** or **Negative Review agent**. A **Revision agent** performs a final quality check before posting.

**Impact:** Zero manual review management. Every review gets a response within 5 minutes, 24/7.

---

### 02 — WhatsApp Lead Agent

An n8n workflow that connects to a Twilio WhatsApp number and runs a conversational AI lead qualification flow. The agent asks structured discovery questions, scores the lead, and either books a call or routes to a CRM pipeline — all within a WhatsApp thread.

**Impact:** Qualifies inbound leads instantly without a human sales rep.

---

### 03 — Vapi Real Estate Booking Agent

**Stevenson** — a voice AI agent built on Vapi for Maplecrest Realty. Handles inbound property inquiries over the phone: answers questions about listings, captures prospect details via structured data extraction, and books property viewings directly into the agent's calendar via an n8n webhook.

**Impact:** A always-on receptionist that converts cold calls into booked viewings.

---

### 04 — Vapi Customer Support Agent

**Alex** — a voice AI customer support agent built on Vapi for CreekSoftware. Handles inbound support calls, resolves Tier-1 issues using a dynamic FAQ knowledge base, and escalates complex cases to human agents with a full call summary.

**Impact:** Deflects 60–70% of support calls without human intervention.

[View project →](./projects/04-vapi-customer-support/)

---

### 05 — Multi-Agent Personal Assistant

A sophisticated n8n orchestration system with specialized sub-agents for email triage (Gmail), calendar management (Google Calendar), CRM updates (HubSpot), SMS alerts (Twilio), and Telegram command handling. A central router agent interprets natural language requests and delegates to the right sub-agent.

**Impact:** A fully automated executive assistant that runs 24/7.

---

### 06 — WhatsApp Event Registration System

A complete event management pipeline over WhatsApp. Ingests event details from a PDF, runs a conversational registration flow, verifies payment screenshots using **OpenAI Vision**, assigns bus seats from an Airtable inventory, and sends automated reminders before the event.

**Impact:** Replaces a manual registration desk with a fully automated system handling hundreds of attendees.

### 07 — AI Law Firm Receptionist

An 8-workflow autonomous receptionist stack for law firms. An AI triage agent classifies every inbound enquiry by intent and urgency, then dispatches to specialist sub-workflows: new client intake creates a Clio contact and matter; appointment scheduling sends clickable booking emails and auto-creates Zoom meetings; a parallel conflict-of-interest checker searches Clio for name and email matches; document generation drafts engagement letters and intake questionnaires; billing pulls outstanding Clio invoices and time entries into a branded HTML summary. All client-facing emails use a consistent branded HTML template. Attorneys receive Slack alerts for emergencies, new clients, and outstanding balances, plus an 8am morning digest of overnight messages.

**Impact:** A solo attorney or small firm can handle 3× the enquiry volume with zero reception staff — and no client message goes unanswered, even at 2am.

---

### 09 — Real Estate — Transaction Launch

A 27-node n8n workflow that fires the moment a real estate deal is marked **Won** in ClickUp. A Claude Sonnet AI agent receives the full ClickUp task and generates a complete structured project plan — client folder name, 5 Drive subfolder names, a 3-section ClickUp checklist with tasks and due dates, a branded client welcome email, an internal project brief, and a Slack message. The workflow then executes that plan across four platforms in parallel: Google Drive folders and subfolders, ClickUp project board with lists and seeded tasks, a conditional client email (guarded for missing addresses), an internal brief with a live Drive link, and a Slack team alert. Full idempotency on re-runs — no duplicate folders or lists regardless of how many times the workflow fires for the same client.

**Impact:** A won deal goes from CRM status change to fully provisioned client project in under 60 seconds — no manual folder creation, no copy-pasting task templates, no missed emails.

### 08 — Weekly KPI Summary — Wellness Practice

A single n8n workflow that delivers an automated weekly business intelligence report to a solo acupuncture practitioner every Monday morning. Three Airtable tables (Business Tracker, Ads Tracker, Social Posts) are fetched in parallel via a fan-out/merge pattern. A JavaScript Code node handles all date-range filtering and KPI aggregation — revenue, clients, hours worked, revenue per hour, ad spend by channel, and social posts by platform — with week-over-week comparisons. KPI data is passed to Claude Sonnet via OpenRouter, which writes 3–5 specific, data-driven business insights. A second Code node renders a fully branded HTML email. Smart alerting fires a separate email when revenue drops sharply, data gaps are detected, or performance falls below benchmarks. A weekly snapshot is also written back to Airtable for historical tracking.

**Impact:** The practitioner opens her inbox every Monday to a complete picture of her practice — no spreadsheets, no manual number-pulling, no analyst.
