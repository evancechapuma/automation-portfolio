## Project Highlights

### 01 — Google Review Responder

A production n8n multi-agent system that monitors Google My Business for new reviews and automatically crafts professional responses. It routes reviews through a **Text Classifier agent** to detect sentiment, then dispatches to either a **Positive Review agent** or **Negative Review agent**. A **Revision agent** performs a final quality check before posting.

**Impact:** Zero manual review management. Every review gets a response within 5 minutes, 24/7.

---

### 02 — WhatsApp Lead Agent

An n8n workflow that connects to a Twilio WhatsApp number and runs a conversational AI lead qualification flow. The agent asks structured discovery questions, scores the lead, and either books a call or routes to a CRM pipeline — all within a WhatsApp thread.

**Impact:** Qualifies inbound leads instantly without a human sales rep.

### 03 — Vapi Real Estate Booking Agent

**Stevenson** — a voice AI agent built on Vapi for Maplecrest Realty. Handles inbound property inquiries over the phone: answers questions about listings, captures prospect details via structured data extraction, and books property viewings directly into the agent's calendar via an n8n webhook.

**Impact:** A always-on receptionist that converts cold calls into booked viewings.

### 04 — Vapi Customer Support Agent

**Alex** — a voice AI customer support agent built on Vapi for CreekSoftware. Handles inbound support calls, resolves Tier-1 issues using a dynamic FAQ knowledge base, and escalates complex cases to human agents with a full call summary.

**Impact:** Deflects 60–70% of support calls without human intervention.

---

### 05 — Multi-Agent Personal Assistant

A sophisticated n8n orchestration system with specialized sub-agents for email triage (Gmail), calendar management (Google Calendar), CRM updates (HubSpot), SMS alerts (Twilio), and Telegram command handling. A central router agent interprets natural language requests and delegates to the right sub-agent.

**Impact:** A fully automated executive assistant that runs 24/7.

---

### 06 — WhatsApp Event Registration System

A complete event management pipeline over WhatsApp. Ingests event details from a PDF, runs a conversational registration flow, verifies payment screenshots using **OpenAI Vision**, assigns bus seats from an Airtable inventory, and sends automated reminders before the event.

**Impact:** Replaces a manual registration desk with a fully automated system handling hundreds of attendees.
