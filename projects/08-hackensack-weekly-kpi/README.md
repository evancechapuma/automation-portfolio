> **A fully automated weekly business intelligence report for a solo acupuncture practice — pulls data from Airtable, calculates KPIs, generates AI insights, and delivers a branded HTML email every Monday morning. Zero manual effort.**

---

## Overview

This workflow runs every Monday at 8 AM Eastern and delivers the practice owner a complete picture of her business for the past 7 days — revenue, clients, hours, ad spend, and social media activity — with week-over-week comparisons, AI-written insights, and automatic alerts when something needs attention.

All data lives in her existing Airtable base. No new tools, no dashboards to log into. The report arrives in her inbox.

---

## Use Case

**Who uses this?**
Solo health and wellness practitioners who track their business data in Airtable and want automated reporting without hiring an analyst or building a dashboard.

**Problem it solves:**
Solo practitioners spend time manually pulling numbers from spreadsheets, calculating week-over-week changes, and trying to spot trends — time that should be spent with clients. Most give up and fly blind.

**Result:**
Every Monday, the practice owner opens her inbox to a full business summary: revenue vs. last week, clients seen, revenue per hour, ad spend by channel, social posts by platform, AI-generated insights specific to her numbers, and flagged alerts if anything looks off.

## Key Features

### Parallel Airtable Fetching
All three Airtable tables (Business Tracker, Ads Tracker, Social Media Posts) are fetched simultaneously — not sequentially — cutting data retrieval time significantly. A Merge node synchronises the branches before processing continues.

### JavaScript Date Filtering
Rather than relying on Airtable filter formulas, all date-range filtering is handled in a JavaScript Code node. Records are filtered into two windows — last 7 days and the previous 7 days — enabling week-over-week comparisons without multiple API calls per table.

### AI-Generated Insights
KPI data is passed to a Claude Sonnet model via OpenRouter. The AI produces 3–5 specific, actionable business insights tailored to that week's exact numbers — not generic advice. Each insight is tagged as positive, neutral, or warning.

### Branded HTML Email
A Code node builds a fully styled HTML email with:
- KPI summary cards (revenue, clients, hours worked + revenue/hr)
- Week-over-week change indicators with colour-coded arrows
- AI insight cards with visual type indicators
- Breakdown tables: payment method, appointment type, session type, ad channel, social platform

### Smart Alerting
The workflow automatically flags and emails alerts for:
- Revenue drop > 20% vs prior week
- No clients logged (possible data entry gap)
- Ad spend with zero clients (tracking mismatch)
- Revenue per hour below the $50/hr benchmark

### Weekly Snapshot
Every run writes a summary record to a `Weekly Snapshots` Airtable table — building a historical record of the practice's performance over time.

## Airtable Schema

The workflow expects three tables in the connected Airtable base:

**Business Tracker**
- `Date` (Date), `Money Collected` (Number), `Clients Seen` (Number), `Hours Worked` (Number), `Payment Method` (Single select), `Appointment Type` (Single select), `Session Type` (Single select)

**Ads Tracker**
- `Date` (Date), `Amount Spent` (Number), `Channel` (Single/Multi select), `Notes` (Text)

**Social Media Posts**
- `Date Posted` (Date), `Platform` (Single select), `Number of posts` (Number), `Post Title` (Text)

**Weekly Snapshots** *(written to by the workflow)*
- `Week Of` (Date), `Revenue` (Number), `Clients Seen` (Number), `Hours Worked` (Number), `Ad Spend` (Number), `Posts` (Number)
