> **Meet Stevenson — Maplecrest Realty's AI receptionist who answers property inquiries, qualifies buyers, and books viewings automatically over the phone.**

---

## Overview

Stevenson is a voice AI agent built on [Vapi](https://vapi.ai) for a fictional real estate agency — Maplecrest Realty. He handles inbound property inquiry calls with a natural, professional voice, answers questions about listings, extracts structured buyer information (budget, timeline, preferred area, property type), and books property viewings directly into the agent's Google Calendar — all via a real-time n8n webhook integration.

This system replaces a human receptionist for all Tier-1 inquiry calls, freeing agents to focus exclusively on in-person meetings and closings.

---

## Use Case

**Who uses this?**
Real estate agencies, independent agents, and property management companies that receive high volumes of inbound inquiry calls and want to qualify prospects and book viewings without phone tag or missed calls.

**Problem it solves:**
Real estate agents miss calls constantly — during showings, negotiations, or after hours. Every missed call is a potential lost commission. Hiring a receptionist is expensive and doesn't scale with call volume.

**Result:**
Stevenson answers 100% of inbound calls, qualifies every caller in under 3 minutes, and books viewings that appear instantly in the agent's calendar — with full caller notes attached. Agents arrive at every showing prepared.

## Key Design Decisions

**Why Vapi over building directly on Twilio + Whisper?**
Vapi handles the full real-time voice stack — STT, LLM turn-taking, TTS, interruption handling, and telephony — out of the box. Building this natively would require significant infrastructure. Vapi lets us focus on the conversation design and business logic.

**How does structured data extraction work?**
Vapi's built-in extraction schema captures `caller_name`, `budget`, `preferred_area`, `property_type`, and `timeline` from the natural conversation. This JSON is delivered to n8n at call end via a webhook, populating the lead log automatically — no manual data entry.

**How is calendar double-booking prevented?**
The `check_availability` tool queries Google Calendar for busy/free blocks across a 5-day window before offering slots. n8n creates the event with a 15-minute buffer on each side, and calendar conflict detection is enabled at the Google Calendar API level.

**What happens if the caller is hostile or confused?**
Stevenson's system prompt includes escalation instructions: after two failed clarification attempts, he offers to transfer the call to a human agent using Vapi's native call transfer feature.
