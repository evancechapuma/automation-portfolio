> **A fully orchestrated AI assistant that manages your inbox, calendar, CRM, and messages — all from a single Telegram command.**

---

## Overview

This n8n multi-agent system acts as a comprehensive personal assistant for busy professionals and business owners. It connects Gmail, Google Calendar, HubSpot CRM, Twilio SMS, and Telegram into a single orchestrated system, with specialized AI sub-agents for each domain.

A central **Router Agent** interprets natural language commands received via Telegram (or SMS) and delegates to the appropriate specialist: the **Email Agent** drafts and triages Gmail, the **Calendar Agent** manages meetings, the **CRM Agent** updates HubSpot contacts and pipelines, and the **Messaging Agent** dispatches Twilio SMS alerts.

---

## Use Case

**Who uses this?**
Entrepreneurs, consultants, and business owners who manage high email/meeting volume and want an AI assistant that understands context — not just keyword triggers.

**Problem it solves:**
Disconnected tools create constant context-switching. Reading emails, updating a CRM, scheduling meetings, and sending follow-up texts all happen in different apps. Each task is small, but together they consume hours per day.

**Result:**
Send one Telegram message: *"Reschedule tomorrow's 2pm call with Sarah to Thursday, and send her a text to let her know."* The assistant reads your calendar, finds the conflict, moves the event, finds Sarah's number in HubSpot, and texts her — all automatically.

## Agent Breakdown

### Router Agent
Classifies incoming commands by domain and extracts structured intent. Returns a JSON routing decision like:
```json
{
  "agent": "calendar",
  "action": "reschedule",
  "entities": {
    "contact": "Sarah",
    "from_time": "tomorrow 2pm",
    "to_time": "Thursday"
  },
  "requires_chain": ["messaging"]
}
```

### Email Agent
- Triages inbox by priority (urgent / important / low)
- Drafts replies in your writing style (learned from past emails)
- Searches Gmail by contact, date range, or keyword
- Applies labels and archives automatically

### Calendar Agent
- Creates, updates, cancels, and queries events
- Checks availability before scheduling
- Handles recurring events and timezone conversion
- Sends meeting invitations via Google Calendar

### CRM Agent
- Creates and updates HubSpot contacts from conversation context
- Logs call notes and email summaries as HubSpot notes
- Moves deals through pipeline stages
- Fetches contact history for context before calls

### Messaging Agent
- Sends immediate or scheduled SMS via Twilio
- Drafts WhatsApp messages (optional Twilio WhatsApp integration)
- Formats messages appropriately for SMS length limits

| *"Mark the Johnson deal as closed-won"* | CRM | Updates HubSpot deal stage |
| *"Text all leads I spoke to this week"* | CRM + Messaging | Fetches recent contacts, sends SMS |
| *"Summarize my unread emails"* | Email | Returns priority-sorted summary |

## Setup Instructions

> **Prerequisites:** n8n instance, Google Cloud project (Gmail + Calendar APIs), HubSpot account, Twilio account, Telegram bot.

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evance262/automation-portfolio.git
   cd automation-portfolio/projects/05-multi-agent-personal-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a Telegram bot**
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
   - Run `/newbot` and follow the prompts
   - Copy the bot token to `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

3. **Enable Google APIs**
   - Enable Gmail API and Google Calendar API in Google Cloud Console
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials with the required scopes
   - Complete the OAuth flow to get a refresh token

4. **Configure n8n**
   - Import `workflow.json` into n8n
   - Connect all credentials: Google OAuth, HubSpot, Twilio, Telegram

5. **Set the Telegram webhook**
   - n8n will automatically register the webhook when you activate the workflow
   - Or manually: `https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/setWebhook?url=YOUR_N8N_WEBHOOK`

6. **Copy environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Fill in all values
   ```

7. **Test**
   - Open Telegram, message your bot: *"What meetings do I have today?"*
   - Verify the Calendar Agent responds with your schedule

## Key Design Decisions

**Why Telegram as the command interface?**
Telegram bots support inline keyboards, file sending, and persistent chat history — making it a richer interface than SMS. It's also free and works globally. SMS via Twilio is supported as a fallback for when Telegram isn't available.

**How is multi-step orchestration handled?**
When the Router Agent detects a command that spans multiple domains (e.g., reschedule + notify), it returns a `requires_chain` array. n8n executes these agents sequentially, passing outputs as inputs to the next stage — creating a lightweight agent pipeline without a separate orchestration framework.

**Security: who can command the assistant?**
The `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_ID` whitelist ensures only your account can issue commands. Any message from an unrecognized user ID is silently dropped. This is a single-tenant system — multi-user support would require an authentication layer.

**How is writing style preserved in email drafts?**
The Email Agent's system prompt includes 3–5 example emails (written by the user) as few-shot examples. This trains the model to match tone, length, sign-off style, and vocabulary — without fine-tuning.
